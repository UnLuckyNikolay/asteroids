For brainstorming

FIXES/TWEAKS:
+++ Buttons pressed on button down, should be button up
+++ AsteroidField doesn't scale with window size change. Asteroid deletion does tho
+++ BombLauncher - Explosion isn't properly scaled with level
+++ Check loot layer
Rename and move UserInterface class
Upgrade movement to properly handle turning of vectors, something is broken when turning without moving

IDEAS:
Redo buttons, rename containers (planes maybe), add `hidden` option to them
Revisit visible naming scheme for ship parts
Add ship recolors (will need new buttons)
Show current timer/difficulty modifier
Additional weapon upgrades (short fuse for the Bomb Launcher, will need naming scheme revisited)

DISTANT IDEAS:
Enemy ships
2 leaderboards instead (one for points, one for gold)
Grahics/color adjustments for the leaderboards
