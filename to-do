For brainstorming

FIXES/TWEAKS:
+++ Buttons pressed on button down, should be button up
+++ AsteroidField doesn't scale with window size change. Asteroid deletion does tho
+++ BombLauncher - Explosion isn't properly scaled with level
+++ Check loot layer
Rename and move UserInterface class (possibly to GameStateManager), rename GameStateManager to RoundStateManager
Upgrade movement to properly handle turning of vectors, something is broken when turning without moving
Update screenshots in README
Check how to add support for different keyboard layouts
Change how max level upgrades are displayed (will need new buttons)
Add minimum asteroid price
Increase alpha of background of the pause menu (might need new buttons)

IDEAS:
Redo buttons, rename containers (`planes` maybe), add `hidden` option to them
Revisit visible naming scheme for ship parts
Add ship recolors (might need new buttons)
More ship skins
More weapons
Show current timer/difficulty modifier
Additional weapon upgrades (short fuse for the Bomb Launcher, will need naming scheme revisited)
Profiles
Persistent upgrades (will need profiles)
Saved name/ship settings (will need profiles)
Graphics/color adjustments for the leaderboards for top places
Bubble (or any other different) explosion vfx for bombs

DISTANT/POSSIBLE IDEAS:
Difficulty selection
Game modes (Classic with only normal asteroids and white/black graphics)
Add amount limit to certain asteroids (mainly Homing)
Enemy ships/bosses
Achievements (will need profiles)
2 leaderboards instead (one for points, one for gold)
Better asteroid sprite
