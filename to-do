For brainstorming

FIXES/TWEAKS:
[X] Buttons pressed on button down, should be button up
[X] AsteroidField doesn't scale with window size change. Asteroid deletion does tho
[X] BombLauncher - Explosion isn't properly scaled with level
[X] Check loot layer
[ ] Rename and move UserInterface class (possibly to GameStateManager), rename GameStateManager to RoundStateManager
[ ] Upgrade movement to properly handle turning of vectors, something is broken when turning without moving
[ ] Update screenshots in README
[X] Check how to add support for different keyboard layouts
[ ] Change how max level upgrades are displayed (will need new buttons)
[ ] Add minimum asteroid price
[ ] Increase alpha of background of the pause menu (might need new buttons)
[X] Redo ship parts and engine (as classes) to add ability to draw different shapes and make it more readable:
    [X] Have classes for parts and engines with draw methods, and lists of parts and engines to draw each from
    [X] Add Line part
    [X] Add Circle part

IDEAS:
[ ] Redo buttons, rename containers (`planes` maybe), add `hidden` option to them
[ ] Revisit visible naming scheme for ship parts
[ ] Add ship recolors (might need new buttons)
[ ] More ship skins:
    [X] UFO - will need new parts and 2 engines
[ ] More weapons
[ ] Show current timer/difficulty modifier
[ ] Additional weapon upgrades:
    [ ] Short fuse for the Bomb Launcher
    [ ] Faster fire rate for Plasma Gun
[ ] Profiles
[ ] Saved name/ship settings (will need profiles)
[ ] Graphics/color adjustments for the leaderboards for top places
[ ] Bubble explosion vfx for bombs
[ ] Add amount limit to certain asteroids (mainly Homing)

DISTANT/POSSIBLE IDEAS:
[ ] Temporary boosts as loot
[ ] Difficulty selection (speed of difficulty ramp-up, max amount of special asteroids)
[ ] Persistent upgrades (will need profiles)
[ ] Game modes (Classic with only normal asteroids and white/black graphics)
[ ] Enemy ships/bosses
[ ] Achievements (will need profiles)
[ ] 2 leaderboards instead (one for points, one for gold)
[ ] Better asteroid sprite
